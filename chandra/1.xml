    <title>THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEAREST STARBURST-DRIVEN GALACTIC WIND</title>
    <category>NORMAL GALAXIES</category>
    <abstract>Starburst-driven winds and superbubbles play a prominent role in the chemical evolution of galaxies and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. In nearby galaxies, enrichment from young star clusters is not detected in the warm phase of the interstellar medium; but the hot phase could well be a reservoir for freshly-ejected metals. We propose to measure the metal mass and Fe to alpha-element ratio in the hot outflow from NGC1569. This dwarf galaxy is better suited to an enrichment measurement than M82 because the metallicity is lower (thus larger dZ/Z). The gravitational potential is also shallower. The abundance of the X-ray halo is currently unknown because of a degeneracy in the spectral models which we can eliminate by resolving and removing discrete, hard sources.</abstract>
