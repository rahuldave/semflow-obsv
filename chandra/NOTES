Chandra uris and other notes
-----------------------------

As opposed to what is being currently done with MAST, i want to keep chandra uris not:
/obsv/MAST/obsid/[obs_id]/data/hash/
/obsv/MAST/obsid/[obs_id]/observation/hash/
but 
/obsv/data/CHANDRA/obsid/[obsid]/hash/
/obsv/observation/CHANDRA/obsid/[obsid]/hash/

and keep hash optional (as its uniqie in chandras case (no multiple row problem)

Need added from Sherry:
data type and data URL
